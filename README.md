side scroller game - maybe platforms
there will be a timer to track how long the player lasts
will track record times, somwhere on a local storage
player will start off with 100 hp
each asteroid will subtract 10 hp
some kind of health potion will drop

Making a game where it's the end of the world.

The dino has to try to survive the first asteroid collisions

then maybe aliens?

number of meteors need to increase as time goes on.

NEED TO REFACTOR THE DRAW CODE SO I CAN DO THE COLLISION CODE AFTER THE UPDATE BUT BEFORE CLEARING THE CANVAS
